# Service-Locator-Pattern

The Service-Locator-Pattern is a design pattern that allows you to easily use and manage services. It is a way to create a singleton object that can be used to register and access services. It is a common way to use dependency injection.

This repository contains a simple example of the Service-Locator-Pattern in typescript. You cand find the source code in the `src/` folder. Explainations are provided in the `README.md` file.

Enjoy!
